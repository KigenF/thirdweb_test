      "description":"City Pop TOKYO characters in the collections are made up of different parts: hair, clothing, accessories, and backgrounds. They are each carefully chosen to represent the essence of Tokyoâ€™s City Pop culture. Some parts are rarer than others, showcasing unique elements that express different periods and cultures.\\n\\n - LEVEL \\n\\n In addition to the rarity of each NFT, the LEVEL of each character represents their training level, which increases as they evolve and grow. With the authenticity of each NFT verified on the blockchain, owning a City Pop TOKYO NFT is a true reflection of the culture and creativity of this amazing city.\\n\\n - NFT TYPE\\n\\n This collection features 13 different NFT types, each with its rarity level based on the clothing worn by the character in the artwork. The NFTs are limited to a supply of 1984, so owning one of these pieces makes you a part of a select group of collectors.",
